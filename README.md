# inventory_management

This code snippet manages an inventory system. It allows you to add, remove, and update products, display product details,
list all products, and calculate the total value of the inventory. It also generates unique product codes, 
converts product names to lowercase, counts vowels in product names, and generates a detailed report of all products.
